    "content": "You're huffing and puffing and starting to sweat — and that's just from walking across the parking lot in blistering heat and humidity. This summer has left us all struggling to stay cool.\"The last 13 months have been the hottest on record. We're seeing increased levels of heat-related illness, and it started earlier in the season we're used to,\" says Dr. Tess Wiskel, a climate change and human health fellow at the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment, and an emergency physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.Don't wait until you're overheated to figure out how to cool down. Be wary of high temperature risks throughout your day and practice ways to avoid them. Here are 14 ideas to get you started.Cover the basicsBecome a weather expert.Use a weather app on your smartphone and pay attention to the hourly temperatures, not just daily highs and lows. Note the hottest points of the day and plan your schedule around them.Stay hydrated.One way the body cools down is by sweating. As moisture on the skin evaporates, it takes heat with it. That's called evaporative heat loss. But you must replace the fluids you lose through a combination of drinks andwater-rich foods. Generally, the National Academy of Medicine recommends totals ofabout 11 cups (88 ounces) per day for women and 15 cups (120 ounces) per day for men. If you spend a lot of time outdoors or are sweating a lot, you'll need even more fluids.Seek air-conditioned environments.As much as possible, hang out in air-conditioned indoor spaces during the hottest points of the day. If you don't have AC, go to a shopping mall, public library, movie theater, or a community cooling center.Use fans correctly.Another way the body cools down is by channeling blood and body heat to vessels near the skin's surface, where heat escapes. A fan can blow that heat away from your body and keep you cool, but not if the surrounding air is hot. \"In that case, wet your skin, even with a spray bottle or a wet wipe. The fan will promote evaporative heat loss,\" Dr. Wiskel says.Take breaks.Pace yourself when doing outdoor activity. \"Physical work produces its own heat at the same time you're being heated from outside,\" Dr. Wiskel says. \"Be active for short periods and rest in between.\"Pack and dress for heatBring cool-downs with you.Any time you leave your home, bring plenty of water. Even better: bring a handheld fan, wet wipes, and ice packs. That way you're prepared if you get stuck outside.Wear loose clothing.Lightweight, loose-fitting garments allow air to get to your skin, promoting evaporative heat loss to keep you cool when you sweat.Try high-tech clothes.Consider wearing clothes with cooling technology (such as tops, bottoms, hats, or neck gaiters). They work in various ways. For example, a garment might be made of a special fabric that's activated with water and stays damp for a long period, continually pulling heat from your body.Try DIY cool downsMake a DIY cooling garment.Dunk a kitchen towel or cotton T-shirt in cold water, wear it on your head, neck, or torso, and then rewet the fabric as it dries. Or buy higher-tech versions made with fabrics and gels designed to stay cool longer.Eat or drink something cold.A cool glass of water, ice chips, or a popsicle help fightdehydrationand might help lower your body's core temperature. Just don't ingest anything too quickly. Dr. Wiskel says it might cause gastrointestinal upset.Cool off with a shower or bath.Experts debate the best temperature for water to cool you down. Some maintain that cool water constricts blood vessels and sends heat back to the core, making you hot again. Others maintain that chilly water cools the blood vessels and sends cooled blood to the core. Dr. Wiskel's take: \"Immerse yourself in water that's cooler than your body temperature. The water can be tepid. Once you're out of the water, stand in front of a fan to promote evaporative heat loss.\"Submerge your forearms.If you can't take a shower or bath, try a trick used by the US Army: submerge your hands, forearms, and elbows in ice water for five minutes. This helps send cooled blood moving through blood vessels back to your core.Apply ice or cold packs.A water-free method to cool blood vessels involves placing ice packs in areas near large blood vessels such as the elbows, underarms, neck, or inside the legs near the groin area.Know when to get helpIf you're not cooling down after trying numerous methods, Dr. Wiskel advises that you seek care. Call your doctor's office or call 911 if you're exhibiting signs ofheat exhaustion, such asexcessive sweatingheadachefeeling faint or dizzycold, clammy skina fast or weak pulseextreme fatiguemuscle cramps.Pay extra attention to those symptoms, especially if you're vulnerable to heat and aren't able to regulate your temperature well.\"People at high risk include older adults, babies and children, those who are pregnant, people who take medications that make them less able to sweat, people who work outdoors, and people with certainhealth conditions, including cardiovascular disease,\" Dr. Wiskel says. \"And if you're not high risk, check in on people who are.\"",

    "content": "As wildfires become more frequent due to climate change and drier conditions, more of us and more of our communities are at risk for harm. Here is information to help you prepare and protect yourself and your family.How does wildfire smoke affect air quality?Wildfire smoke contributes greatly to poor air quality. Just like pollution from burning coal, oil, and gas, wildfires create hazardous gases and tiny particles of varying sizes that are harmful to breathe. Wildfire smoke also contains other toxins that come from burning buildings and chemical storage.Smoke carried by weather patterns and jet streams can cross state and national boundaries, traveling to distant regions.How does wildfire smoke affect our health?The small particles in wildfire smoke –– known as particulate matter, or PM10, PM2.5, PM0.1 –– are the most worrisome to our health. When we breathe them in, these particles can travel deep into the lungs and sometimes into the bloodstream.The health effects of wildfire smoke include eye andskin irritation, coughing, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Other possible serious health effects includeheart failure, heart attacks, and strokes.Who needs to be especially careful?Those most at risk from wildfire smoke include children, older adults, outdoor workers, and anyone who is pregnant or who has heart or lung conditions.If you have a chronic health condition, talk to your doctor about how the smoke might affect you. Find out what symptoms should prompt medical attention or adjustment of your medications. This is especially important if you have lung problems or heart problems.What can you do to prepare for wildfire emergencies?If you live in an area threatened by wildfires, or where heat and dry conditions make them more likely to occur:Create anevacuation planfor your family before a wildfire occurs.Make sure that you have several days on hand of medications, water, and food that doesn’t need to be cooked. This will help if you need to leave suddenly due to a wildfire or anothernatural disaster.Regularly check thisfire and smoke map, which shows current wildfire conditions and has links to state advisories.Follow alerts from local officials if you are in the region of an active fire.What steps can you take to lower health risks during poor air quality days?These six tips can help you stay healthy during wildfire smoke advisories and at other times when air quality is poor:Stay aware of air quality.AirNow.govshares real-time air quality risk category for your area accompanied by activity guidance. When recommended, stay indoors, close doors, windows, and any outdoor air intake vents.Consider buying an air purifier.This is also important even when there are no regional wildfires if you live in a building that is in poor condition. The EPA recommendsavoiding air cleaners that generate ozone, which is also a pollutant.Understand your HVAC system if you have one.The quality and cleanliness of your filters counts, so choosehigh-efficiency filtersif possible, and replace these as needed. It’s also important to know if your system has outdoor air intake vents.Avoid creating indoor pollution.That means no smoking, no vacuuming, and no burning of products like candles or incense. Avoid frying foods or using gas stoves, especially if your stove is not well ventilated.Make a “clean room.”Choose a room with fewer doors and windows. Run an air purifier that is the appropriate size for this room, especially if you are not using central AC to keep cool.Minimize outdoor time and wear a mask outside.Again, ensuring that you have several days of medications and food that doesn’t need to be cooked will help. If you must go outdoors, minimize time and level of activity. A well-fitted N95 or KN95 mask or P100 respirator can help keep you from breathing in small particles floating in smoky air.",

    "content": "In this two-part series, we’ll describe the PSA test — how it’s used, and how doctors perform next steps in the event of an abnormal reading. Our first post addresses PSA screening for prostate cancer. In the second part of our series, we’ll describe how doctors use the PSA test to check the status of a cancer that’s being watched or treated.PSA testing: Screening for prostate cancerAll prostate cells make PSA, a protein that helps to dissolve semen so that sperm cells can more easily reach and fertilize an egg. Normal and cancerous cells in the prostate each make PSA in similar amounts. But since cancer cells are leakier, they release more of the protein into the bloodstream.PSA screening for prostate cancer came into widespread use during the early 1990s. But the test is controversial: prostate cancer grows slowly, and the concern is that PSA screening flags too many low-grade tumors that might not be harmful during a man’s life. Still, studies do suggest that PSA testing, because it can detect cancers at early and more treatable stages, can be lifesaving in some cases.The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an influential volunteer panel of experts in prevention and evidence-based medicine, takes a cautious stance on the matter. The USPSTF advises doctors to discuss the pros and cons of PSA screening in men ages 55 to 69, but also cautionsagainstscreening men over the age of 70, and gives no recommendation at all for men under 55.Some expert groups recommend earlier screening for men in higher-risk groups. Black men, for instance, are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with and die from prostate cancer than white men. The American Cancer Society (ACS) advises PSA screening for Black men at age 45, or even earlier screening for men with first-degree relatives who developed prostate cancer at young ages, as well as for men who test positive for mutations in certain cancer risk genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2.Importantly, activities that put pressure on the prostate gland (such as biking and sex) can cause PSA levels in blood to spike, so you should refrain from these activities for two to three days prior to testing. Health conditions affecting the prostate, such as infections, inflammation (prostatitis), or enlargement of the gland that occurs normally in older men (benign prostatic hyperplasia), can also cause PSA levels to spike in ways that are unrelated to cancer.What is an abnormal PSA result?In general, PSA levels over 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) in blood are considered abnormal. But doctors may also vary PSA cutoffs by age. For instance, a PSA of 3.5 ng/mL for a man in his 40s “is definitely abnormal,” says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, the Gorman Brothers Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and editor in chief of theHarvard Medical School Guide to Prostate Diseases. However, a PSA of 5.5 ng/mL among men in their 60s, Dr. Garnick adds, may not be. It’s best to think of PSA values as being on a continuum, with higher levels associated with having prostate cancer.PSA testing can sometimes miss a cancer diagnosis altogether. One study found that up to 15% of men with PSA levels under 4 ng/mL actually did have prostate cancer, and a sizeable fraction of these tumors were clinically significant. It’s also possible for high-grade cancer to be present without causing a large increase in PSA. That’s because high-grade cancer cells can lose their ability to actually make the protein.What are next steps after an abnormal result?It used to be that elevated PSA readings were followed routinely by a prostate biopsy, and then treatment if cancer was detected.Today the paradigm is shifting. An abnormal result is now likely to be followed by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which can identify areas of the prostate gland that look suspicious for cancer. In Europe and some hospitals in the US, men with abnormal PSA readings might avoid an initial biopsy altogether if the MRI results are negative. However, many physicians will still opt for an initial biopsy in such cases, followed by periodic PSA tests and MRI scans to determine if further biopsies are needed.If the initial biopsy and MRI results are positive, then doctors will perform a targeted biopsy focused on areas where the MRI showed evidence of cancer. If a cancer diagnosis is confirmed, then next steps will be initiated. Today, many low-grade cancers are watched with active surveillance, and treated only if follow-up biopsies and MRI scans show worsening of the disease. Higher-grade cancers will be treated immediately.\"The goal of this risk-adapted approach to screening,\" Dr. Garnick says, is to “identify clinically significant cancers that actually do need treatment while decreasing diagnoses of clinically insignificant cancers that do not.”Variations on the PSA testRather than subject everyone with an elevated PSA reading to a biopsy, some doctors perform additional tests that involve more detailed interpretations of PSA levels.Free PSAtesting looks for PSA that isn’t bound to other proteins. Low percentages of free PSA are associated with higher cancer risk.PSA densitydivides the total PSA level in ng/mL by the volume of the prostate gland in milliliters. A PSA density of 0.15 ng/mL or higher may be associated with prostate cancer.PSA velocitytracks how fast PSA levels increase from test to test.Prostate Health Indexcombines total PSA, free PSA, and a type of PSA called proPSA. Some evidence suggests it diagnoses prostate cancer more accurately than PSA by itself.In the next part of our series, we’ll address how PSA is used as a test for monitoring and managing patients with prostate cancer.",
